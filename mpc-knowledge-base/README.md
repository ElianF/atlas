# MPC Knowledge Base

Systematically collect information on secure multi-party computation.

# MPC Reading group

Some ideas for a reading group:
  * Scope: What kinds of papers are interesting to us? 
	* Foundational techniques of general purpose MPC
	* specific MPC systems for machine learning applications, etc
  * Mode: "Classic reading group", i.e. short presentation by one person, afterwards discussion; or something else?
  * Frequency: Meet every other week?
